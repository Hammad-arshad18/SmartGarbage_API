                        Pakistan, with a population of 227 million, is the world's fifth-most populous country. The heap
                        of garbage is a common sight in the urban areas of Pakistan. Mismanagement of garbage management
                        causes soil erosion, air, and water contamination which ultimately creates health and
                        environmental hazards for the citizens of Pakistan. Diarrhea, pneumonia, and the release of
                        methane are a few examples of these hazards.
                        It is, therefore, important to devise an efficient mechanism for waste management. With the help
                        of modern and emerging technologies, the concerned authorities can reform the process of waste
                        management in the right direction in Pakistan.
                        This project proposes a comprehensive solution for waste management. It is a software and
                        hardware-based solution that will facilitate municipal corporations, residents of urban areas,
                        and other concerned authorities for the effective management of waste. To reap the benefits of
                        an integrated system for waste management, this project utilizes the concepts of the Internet of
                        Things (IoT) and Deep Learning. The system will be a hybrid application (i.e., usage of web and
                        mobile-based technologies). It will identify the piles of garbage on the streets and the roads.
                        For this purpose, sensors such as cameras will be installed in the various locations of a city.
                        These cameras will send images to a web server through microcontrollers where a deep
                        learning-based trained model will identify the presence of the piles of garbage. After the
                        identification of the garbage, the system will generate alerts for the authorities and
                        janitorial staff of that area. It will also send the exact location of the piles of garbage to
                        the mentioned authorities and the staff. The tasks of the waste collection can be assigned
                        automatically by identifying the janitorial staff on duty. On the other hand, the head of the
                        janitorial staff can also assign a task if needed. The system keeps checking the status of the
                        assigned task (if the piles of garbage are collected or not) after the interval set by the head.
                        After the task completion, it generates a report. Moreover, the system also keeps an eye on the
                        performance of the staff in each area. It also identifies the staff of the month and the year
                        which are selected on the basis of the cleanliness of the assigned area. The residents of an
                        area can also lodge complaints regarding the cleanliness of their areas through the mobile
                        application. Consequently, making a contribution to maintaining cleanliness in their city. In
                        short, the proposed system will bring the stakeholders in one place for achieving the
                        sustainable goal of a neat and clean Pakistan.

                        The primary objective is to resolve the issue of improper waste management in Pakistan. For this
                        purpose, the proposed solution will bring all the stakeholders on one platform where they will
                        work together for achieving the mentioned goal. The deep-learning-based intelligent algorithm
                        will help in the identification of heaps of garbage in the city. Moreover, it will also improve
                        the performance of janitorial staff and the concerned authorities by evaluating their
                        performance. In addition to this, based on the system-generated reports, the government
                        officials can perceive the future needs and consequently, plan for waste management in the
                        future. Resultantly, creating an environment and climate-friendly happy lifestyle for the
                        citizens of Pakistan.

                        The proposed system is a hybrid application, i.e., web and mobile-based. It is noteworthy that
                        the web application is developed using the Django REST framework which is a Python-based web
                        open-source framework that follows the model-template-views architectural pattern. The mobile
                        application is a cross-platform application that is developed using Flutter. It is an
                        open-source UI software development kit created by Google. For database management, MySQL (for
                        users’ and waste management records), Firebase (for generating alerts), and SQLite (for keeping
                        the records of tasks and complaints on the mobile users’ side).
                        In the first phase, the system will keep monitoring the status of the roads and the streets
                        where cameras are installed. For this purpose, the ESP 32 cameras will be connected to the
                        webserver through Raspberry Pi 4B microcontrollers. The captured images will be sent to a web
                        server where the piles of garbage will be identified with the help of a trained deep-learning
                        model in the second phase. YOLO algorithm is a strong candidate for this purpose. The training
                        will be carried out using various datasets of the piles of garbage. The trained model will label
                        the piles of garbage. As soon as the pile of garbage is identified by the system, it will
                        generate alerts for the authorities through web and mobile applications. The alerts will be
                        generated for those staff members who will be on duty on that day and time. For this purpose,
                        the concerned authorities and the janitorial staff will be registered on the system. The head of
                        each area will be able to enter the working days of the staff. The system will have the
                        capability to assign the task of collecting the garbage to a staff member who is available in a
                        nearby area. In addition to this, the head of janitorial staff may also assign the task
                        manually. The system will keep monitoring the place where the pile of the garbage is identified.
                        As soon as the area is cleaned, it will change the task status as completed. If the task is not
                        completed within the stipulated time, the system will send an alert to the higher management of
                        that area. Moreover, it will keep monitoring the performance of the staff on a monthly and
                        yearly basis. The system will also consider the number of complaints lodged by the residents of
                        the area. The waste management authority may assign a staff member to deal with the complaints
                        of the residents. A comprehensive report regarding the resolution of the complaints will also be
                        generated for the higher authorities. It will also generate a report regarding the cleanliness
                        of the area on a monthly and yearly basis.
