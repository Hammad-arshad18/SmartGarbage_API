                        One of the biggest problems that municipalities around Pakistan have to deal with is waste
                        management.
                        Everyday waste leaves the homes of citizens and then arrives in the designated waste collection
                        areas,
                        which in turn have to be transported by waste workers to waste collection and treatment centers.
                        Unfortunately, in this process, various problems arise which have an impact on the environment
                        and
                        on
                        peopleâ€™s quality of life, In Pakistan, there are a lot of things that need to solve to make
                        Pakistan
                        a
                        well-developing country. This is one of the major problems that need to be solved. This makes
                        Pakistan
                        dirty & unhealthy for our health because that thing creates a lot of diseases which make people
                        ill.
                        As
                        Countries are going smart day by day there is a need to develop the intelligent & most efficient
                        way
                        to
                        solve this problem. For this problem, this system enables Pakistan to become neat & clean. The
                        System
                        detects garbage through cameras & generates alerts to the system. The department of Refinement
                        sends
                        the
                        team to the particular area & cleans the whole garbage/garbage from that area.
                        This makes us safe from many of the major diseases like Malaria & Dengue caused by mosquitos.
